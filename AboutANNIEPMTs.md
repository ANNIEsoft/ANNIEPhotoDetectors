# About ANNIE PMTs

This document is intended to be a clearing-house for all of the information related to the conventional PMTs used in ANNIE.
There are several stocks of PMTs:
* 4? WATCHBOY PMTs: These PMTs were loaned to us by the WATChMAN collaboration (from the WATCHBOY detector). 
They are Hamamastu RXXX, 10" PMTs, already mounted on acrylic holders
* 19 LUX PMTs: These 10" PMTs came from the LUX experiment. They are Hamamatsu RXXX, the same type as the WATCHBOY tubes.
However they are pre-mounted in upward facing PVC-based housings
* XX ETEL 11" PMTs: These 11" type-YYYY tubes come from the former LBNE testing effort and are to be mounted in the same style of housing
as the LUX tubes.
* 40 Hamamatsu RXXX 8" HQE tubes: these tubes are being ordered new from Hamamatsu, and will arrive water-proofed. They will be
mounted in the same housings used for ANNIE Phase I.
* XX WATCHMAN 10" HQE test PMTs: these Hamamatsu RXXXXX 10" tubes are the HQE variant of the WATCHBOY tubes.
